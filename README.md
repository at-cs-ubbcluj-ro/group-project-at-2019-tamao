Project idea:
The aim of the project is to demonstrate how to use a water sensor and raindrop module to measure the water level. We take the input of a water sensor, which was placed in a container, such that we can detect water raising/lowering. We also have a raindrop module, which detects drops of water that fall on it and after a (programmable) number of drops adds an entry to the cloud database (Firebase). The companion phone application sends the user a notification when a new value entries the database.
